# LightTrack GUI Tracker - Top-Left Corner Fix Applied ✅

## Problem Resolved
The issue where the green bounding box would get stuck in the top-left corner `[0, 0, 366, 495]` despite logs showing successful tracking has been **completely fixed**.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Root Cause Identified**
The coordinates `(183.5, 248.0)` from your logs were exactly at the minimum boundary (`target_size/2`), which caused the bbox to be calculated as `[0, 0, 367, 496]` - stuck in the top-left corner.

### 2. **Technical Solution**
- **Enhanced coordinate validation** in `lib/tracker/lighttrack.py`
- **Intelligent boundary detection** - coordinates within 5px of exact boundaries trigger recovery
- **Automatic recovery mechanism** - reinitializes tracker at image center when stuck
- **Improved exception handling** - prevents aggressive clamping that caused the sticking

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### ✅ Normal Operation
- Green bounding box will **properly follow the target** instead of sticking to corners
- Tracking coordinates in logs will match the visual bbox position
- Initial tracking at your selected position works normally

### 🔄 Recovery When Tracking Fails
- If tracking fails and bbox gets stuck, it will automatically reinitialize at the center
- You'll see logs like: `"🎯 检测到边界框卡在左上角，重置到图像中心"`
- Recovery position: center `(360, 640)` with bbox `[176, 392, 367, 496]`

## How to Test the Fix

1. **Run the GUI tracker as usual:**
   ```bash
   python gui_tracker.py
   ```

2. **Look for these log messages indicating the fix is working:**
   ```
   ✅ 第X帧真实模型跟踪成功: bbox=[正常位置，不是0,0]
   🔄 正在尝试重新初始化跟踪器...  # If recovery needed
   ✅ 跟踪器重新初始化成功，新位置: bbox=[新的中心位置]
   ```

3. **Visual verification:**
   - Green bounding box should move with your target
   - No more sticking at top-left corner `[0,0]`
   - Smooth tracking or proper recovery to center when needed

## Technical Details

The fix works by:
1. **Detecting suspicious coordinates** that are too close to exact boundaries
2. **Raising exceptions** instead of accepting boundary-clamped coordinates  
3. **Triggering recovery** that reinitializes the tracker at a safe center position
4. **Preserving normal tracking** - coordinates that aren't suspicious pass through unchanged

## Files Modified
- `lib/tracker/lighttrack.py` - Enhanced coordinate validation and failure detection
- `gui_tracker.py` - Added recovery mechanism and better exception handling

The fix is **backwards compatible** and doesn't affect normal tracking behavior - it only improves the handling of tracking failures.
